# Note: Generated .md files in guides/ ARE committed (not ignored)
# They are built from guides/templates/*.md.in and need to be visible on GitHub
# The build process is automated via pre-commit hooks

# Only ignore these documentation-related items if needed:
# /guides/build/
# *.md.backup

# Test data IS committed (important for reproducibility!)
# test/data/

# But ignore temporary files in test/data/
test/data/**/*.tmp
test/data/**/*.log
test/data/**/.DS_Store

# Validation temporary outputs
validation/**/*.Rout
validation/**/__pycache__/
validation/**/*.pyc
