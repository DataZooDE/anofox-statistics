    "# Automatic Identification of Demand (AID)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Failure of \"Syntactic\" Classification. The traditional approach to supply chain analysis, known as Syntactic Classification (SBC), relies on calculating summary statistics—specifically the Average Demand Interval (ADI) and the Coefficient of Variation squared ($CV^2$) — and mapping them to a matrix with fixed thresholds (classically $ADI=1.32$ and $CV^2=0.49$). The paper [Why do zeroes happen? A model-based approach for demand classification](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.05894v1) (Svetunkov & Sroginis 2025) identifies critical failures in this industry-standard approach:\n",
    "- **Arbitrary Boundaries:** The cutoffs (like 1.32) are mathematically derived from specific theoretical assumptions that rarely hold in real-world data. A product with an ADI of 1.31 is treated fundamentally differently from one with 1.33, causing \"classification flip-flopping\" where stable products jump between categories (e.g., from \"Smooth\" to \"Lumpy\") due to minor noise\n",
    "- **Ambiguity of Zeros**: SBC counts zeros but ignores their context. It cannot distinguish between Structural Zeros (product not yet launched), Censored Zeros (stockouts), and Stochastic Zeros (pure random intermittency).\n",
    "- **Loss of Distributional Information:** Knowing a product is \"Erratic\" is not enough to optimise inventory. You need to know if the demand follows a Gamma, Log-Normal, or Negative Binomial distribution to calculate safety stock accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This DuckDB extension implements the Model-Based Classification (MBC) approach proposed in the paper, which is also in the R package [greybox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/greybox/index.html) available. Instead of relying on brittle ADI/CV thresholds, multiple probabilistic models (Poisson, Negative Binomial, Normal, etc.) are fitted to the data. It selects the classification based on Information Criteria (AIC), identifying the model that minimises information loss. This provides a rigorous, statistically stable foundation for all subsequent supply chain decisions."

    "Most ERP systems use \"3-Sigma\" (Standard Deviation) to detect outliers. This assumes a Normal (Bell Curve) distribution. The paper argues this is disastrous for supply chains because demand is often skewed (right-tailed).

This may be just a rough estimation and need addiotional adjustment and/or more sophisticated methods.\n",

    "**Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, demand data suffers from all these issues simultaneously: non-normality, stockouts, lifecycle changes, and outliers. Disjointed tools that fix only one problem (e.g., just outlier detection) often make the others worse. The paper concludes that a robust system must model the joint probability of these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "This final example aggregates all AID features into a \"Control Tower\" view. It represents the Model-Based ideal: a holistic assessment that simultaneously cleans anomalies, accounts for stockouts, fits the distribution, and determines lifecycle status, delivering a single, scientifically valid truth for every SKU."
