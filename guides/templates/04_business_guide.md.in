# Business Guide

Real-world business applications of the Anofox Statistics extension, demonstrating how to turn data into actionable business insights.

## Important Note About Examples

**All examples below are copy-paste runnable!** Each example includes sample data creation.

**Working Patterns**:
- **Aggregate functions** (`ols_fit_agg`, `ols_coeff_agg`) work directly with table data - use these for GROUP BY analysis
- **Table functions** (`ols_inference`, `ols_predict_interval`) require literal arrays - examples show small datasets with explicit arrays
- All functions use positional parameters only (no `:=` syntax)

**To adapt for your tables**: Replace sample data creation with your actual tables. For table functions with large datasets, use the two-step approach: run `SELECT LIST(column) FROM table`, copy result, paste as literal array.

## Marketing Analytics

### Use Case 1: Marketing Mix Modeling

**Business Question**: Which marketing channels drive the most sales?

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_1_marketing_mix_modeling.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **ROI (coefficient)**: For every $1 increase in channel spend, revenue increases by $X
- **R²**: How well the channel spend predicts revenue (higher is better)
- Univariate analysis shows individual channel impact

**Business Decision**: Prioritize channels with highest ROI. Digital and TV show strongest returns.

### Use Case 2: Price Elasticity Analysis

**Business Question**: How sensitive are customers to price changes?

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_2_price_elasticity_analysis.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Negative elasticity**: Lower prices → higher quantity (normal demand curve)
- **High |elasticity|**: Elastic demand - customers are price-sensitive
- **R²**: How well price predicts quantity

**Business Decision**: Use competitive pricing for elastic categories, premium pricing for inelastic categories.

### Use Case 3: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

**Business Question**: Predict future customer value to guide acquisition spending.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_3_customer_lifetime_value_predi.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Coefficient**: Impact of each factor on customer lifetime value
- **R²**: How well features predict CLV
- **Tenure** and **frequency** typically show strongest CLV correlation

**Business Decision**: Focus acquisition on customers likely to have high tenure and purchase frequency.

### Use Case 3b: Customer Segment Analysis with WLS Aggregate

**Business Question**: How do customer segments differ in their spending patterns? Are some segments more reliable to analyze than others?

**Method**: Use `anofox_statistics_wls_agg` with GROUP BY to fit separate models per segment, weighting by customer value or data reliability.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_customer_segments_wls.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Weighted coefficients**: Estimated while giving more influence to high-value or reliable customers
- **weighted_mse**: Model error accounting for customer weights
- **Segment differences**: Premium customers may show different behavior than budget customers

**Why use WLS here**:
- **High-value customers**: Weight by LTV - premium customers get more influence in the model
- **Data reliability**: Weight by transaction count - customers with more data points get higher weight
- **Heteroscedasticity**: Variance may differ across customer types (premium vs budget)

**Business Decision**:
- **Premium segment**: If income sensitivity is high, target promotions at income milestones
- **Budget segment**: If income sensitivity is low, focus on value messaging rather than income targeting
- **Resource allocation**: Prioritize strategies for segments with strong, reliable patterns (high R², low weighted_mse)

**Example Insights**:
```
Premium segment: income_coef = 0.15, weighted_mse = 250 → Strong income effect, reliable estimate
Budget segment: income_coef = 0.08, weighted_mse = 180 → Weaker income effect, tighter variance
```

## Financial Analytics

### Use Case 4: Portfolio Beta Calculation

**Business Question**: Measure market sensitivity of each stock for risk management.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_4_portfolio_beta_calculation.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Beta = 1.0**: Moves with market (average risk)
- **Beta > 1.0**: More volatile than market (higher risk, higher potential return)
- **Beta < 1.0**: Less volatile than market (lower risk, lower potential return)
- **R² > 0.7**: Strong correlation with market

**Example Output**:
```
┌──────────────┬──────┬───────────┬───────────────┬───────────────────────┐
│ stock_ticker │ beta │ r_squared │ risk_category │ investor_suitability  │
├──────────────┼──────┼───────────┼───────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ TECH         │ 1.45 │ 0.823     │ High Risk     │ Aggressive            │
│ GROWTH       │ 1.18 │ 0.756     │ High Risk     │ Aggressive            │
│ INDEX        │ 0.98 │ 0.912     │ Medium Risk   │ Moderate              │
│ UTILITY      │ 0.42 │ 0.645     │ Low Risk      │ Defensive             │
└──────────────┴──────┴───────────┴───────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

**Business Decision**: Balance portfolio with mix of high/low beta stocks based on risk tolerance.

### Use Case 4b: Multi-Factor Portfolio Analysis with Ridge Aggregate

**Business Question**: How do multiple risk factors (market, sector, value) affect each stock? Handle correlated factors without multicollinearity issues.

**Method**: Use `anofox_statistics_ridge_agg` with GROUP BY to fit factor models per stock with L2 regularization to handle correlated risk factors.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_portfolio_beta_ridge.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Market beta**: Stock's sensitivity to overall market movements
- **Sector beta**: Stock's sensitivity to sector-specific movements
- **Value factor**: Stock's tilt toward value vs growth stocks
- **Lambda (regularization)**: Controls shrinkage - stabilizes estimates when factors are correlated

**Why use Ridge here**:
- **Multicollinearity**: Market and sector returns are often correlated
- **Stability**: Ridge produces more stable factor exposures than OLS
- **Better out-of-sample**: Regularization prevents overfitting to historical patterns
- **Risk management**: More reliable factor exposures for hedging strategies

**Business Decision**:
- **Factor exposure**: Understand true drivers of each stock's returns
- **Portfolio construction**: Build factor-neutral or factor-tilted portfolios
- **Hedging**: Use stable factor estimates for risk management
- **Comparison**: Stocks with similar factor profiles can be treated as substitutes

**Choosing lambda**:
- **lambda = 0.1**: Light regularization (factors mostly uncorrelated)
- **lambda = 1.0**: Moderate regularization (standard choice)
- **lambda = 10.0**: Heavy regularization (factors highly correlated)

**Example Insights**:
```
TECH: market_beta = 1.2, sector_beta = 0.8, value = -0.3 → Growth stock, sector-heavy
UTIL: market_beta = 0.5, sector_beta = 0.3, value = 0.2 → Defensive stock, value tilt
```

### Use Case 5: Credit Risk Modeling

**Business Question**: Predict loan default risk to optimize lending decisions.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_5_credit_risk_modeling.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Positive coefficient**: Factor increases default probability
- **Negative coefficient**: Factor decreases default probability
- **P-value < 0.05**: Factor is statistically significant predictor

**Business Decision**: Adjust lending criteria based on most significant risk factors.

### Use Case 6: Revenue Forecasting with Trend Analysis

**Business Question**: Forecast next quarter's revenue with confidence intervals.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_6_revenue_forecasting_with_tren.sql -->

**Example Output**:
```
┌────────────────┬────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐

└────────────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Business Decision**: Plan for $52.3M revenue in Q21, with contingency plans for $48-56M range.

## Operational Analytics

### Use Case 7: Demand Forecasting for Inventory

**Business Question**: Optimize inventory levels by predicting product demand.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_7_demand_forecasting_for_invent.sql -->

**Business Decision**: Automate replenishment for high-confidence products, manual review for others.

### Use Case 7b: Adaptive Demand Forecasting with RLS Aggregate

**Business Question**: How can we create forecasts that automatically adapt to changing demand patterns per product? Which products have the most volatile demand?

**Method**: Use `anofox_statistics_rls_agg` with GROUP BY to fit adaptive models per product that emphasize recent patterns over historical data.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_adaptive_forecasting_rls.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Adaptive coefficients**: Final model emphasizes recent demand patterns, automatically adjusting to changes
- **forgetting_factor**: Controls adaptation speed - lower values = faster response to changes
- **Per-product models**: Each product gets its own adaptive forecast model
- **Recent emphasis**: Old data is exponentially down-weighted

**Why use RLS here**:
- **Non-stationary demand**: Product demand patterns change over time (seasonality, trends, market shifts)
- **Fast adaptation**: Detects and responds to demand regime changes quickly
- **Automatic updates**: No need to retrain models - they adapt as new data arrives
- **Relevant patterns**: Recent data often predicts better than old data for operational decisions

**Business Decision**:
- **Inventory planning**: Use adaptive forecasts for ordering decisions
- **Volatility assessment**: Products with high forgetting_factor needs indicate unstable demand
- **Promotional impact**: RLS automatically adjusts to post-promotion demand changes
- **New product launches**: Adapts quickly as demand patterns stabilize

**Choosing forgetting_factor**:
- **λ = 0.98-0.99**: Slow adaptation - stable products with gradual changes
- **λ = 0.95-0.97**: Moderate adaptation - standard operational forecasting
- **λ = 0.90-0.94**: Fast adaptation - volatile products or rapid market changes
- **λ < 0.90**: Very fast - new products or post-disruption recovery

**Example Insights**:
```
Product A: coef = 1.2, λ = 0.95 → Growing demand, moderate volatility
Product B: coef = 0.8, λ = 0.90 → Declining demand, high volatility - needs attention
Product C: coef = 1.0, λ = 0.98 → Stable demand, predictable pattern
```

**Operational Actions**:
- **High adaptation needs (λ < 0.93)**: Review demand drivers, increase safety stock
- **Stable patterns (λ > 0.97)**: Can use tighter inventory controls
- **Growing trends (coef > 1.0)**: Plan capacity increases
- **Declining trends (coef < 1.0)**: Review product positioning, consider promotions

### Use Case 8: Quality Control Process Optimization

**Business Question**: Identify which process parameters affect product defects.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_8_quality_control_process_optim.sql -->

**Business Decision**: Optimize process parameters that significantly affect defect rates.

### Use Case 9: Employee Productivity Analysis

**Business Question**: Understand factors driving team productivity.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_9_employee_productivity_analysi.sql -->

**Business Decision**: Allocate training budget to departments with highest ROI.

## Sales Analytics

### Use Case 10: Territory Performance Analysis

**Business Question**: Which territories are underperforming and why?

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_use_case_10_territory_performance_analys.sql -->

**Business Decision**: Prioritize intervention in declining territories, invest in rising stars.

### Use Case 11: Regional Sales Analysis with OLS Aggregate

**Business Question**: How does pricing elasticity differ across regions? Which regions are most price-sensitive?

**Method**: Use `anofox_statistics_ols_agg` with GROUP BY to fit separate price-demand models per region in a single query.

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_sales_by_region_aggregate.sql -->

**Business Interpretation**:
- **Price elasticity coefficient**: How quantity responds to price changes in each region
- **Negative values**: Normal demand curve - higher price → lower demand
- **R²**: How well price predicts demand in each region
- **Regional differences**: Some regions may be more price-sensitive than others

**Business Decision**:
- **High |elasticity| regions**: Use competitive pricing strategies, run promotions carefully
- **Low |elasticity| regions**: Can support premium pricing, focus on value messaging
- **Poor fit (low R²)**: Price isn't the main driver - investigate other factors (competition, demographics)

**Example Insights**:
```
North region: elasticity = -1.2, R² = 0.85 → Price-sensitive, good fit
South region: elasticity = -0.4, R² = 0.72 → Less price-sensitive, moderate fit
```

## Key Business Metrics & Interpretation

### Understanding R² (R-Squared)

**What it means**: Percentage of variation in outcome explained by your model.

- **R² = 0.95**: Model explains 95% of variation (excellent for forecasting)
- **R² = 0.70**: Model explains 70% of variation (good for business decisions)
- **R² = 0.40**: Model explains 40% of variation (use with caution)

**Business Context**:
- **Marketing**: R² > 0.6 is strong (many external factors)
- **Finance**: R² > 0.7 expected (more predictable)
- **Operations**: R² > 0.8 desired (controlled environment)

### Understanding P-Values

**What it means**: Probability that relationship is due to chance.

- **p < 0.001**: Extremely strong evidence (***) - Very confident
- **p < 0.01**: Strong evidence (**) - Confident
- **p < 0.05**: Moderate evidence (*) - Reasonably confident
- **p > 0.05**: Weak evidence - Not confident

**Business Rule**: Only act on factors with p < 0.05 (95% confidence).

### Understanding Coefficients

**What it means**: How much Y changes when X increases by 1 unit.

**Example**: Marketing spend coefficient = 3.2
- For every $1 increase in marketing, revenue increases by $3.20
- ROI = 3.2 - 1 = 2.2, or 220% return

**Business Decision Framework**:
- If coefficient × volume > costs, invest
- If p-value < 0.05, trust the estimate
- If R² > 0.7, forecast with confidence

### Understanding Confidence Intervals

**What it means**: Range where true value likely falls (e.g., 90% or 95% confidence).

**Example**: Revenue forecast = $50M with 90% CI [$45M, $55M]
- Best estimate: $50M
- Conservative plan: $45M
- Optimistic plan: $55M
- Planning buffer: $5M variance

**Business Application**:
- **Budgeting**: Use lower bound (conservative)
- **Target Setting**: Use point estimate (realistic)
- **Capacity Planning**: Use upper bound (optimistic)

### Understanding Outliers & Influence

**Outliers**: Data points that don't fit the pattern.
**Influential**: Points that strongly affect the model.

**Business Decisions**:
- **Outlier + Influential**: Investigate (data error or special case?)
- **Outlier + Not Influential**: Monitor (unusual but not problematic)
- **Not Outlier + Influential**: Normal leverage point

**Example**:
- Q4 sales spike (outlier) due to holiday season → Keep (real pattern)
- Data entry error showing $10M sale → Remove (data quality issue)

## ROI Analysis Framework

### Marketing Campaign ROI

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_marketing_campaign_roi.sql -->

### Process Improvement ROI

**Formula**: (Defect Reduction × Cost per Defect) - Implementation Cost

Use regression to quantify defect reduction from process changes.

## Best Practices for Business Users

### 1. Always Check Statistical Significance

Don't act on p-values > 0.05 unless you have strong business reasons.

### 2. Validate Model Quality

- Check R² before making forecasts
- Review residual diagnostics for unusual patterns
- Look for influential outliers

### 3. Use Confidence Intervals for Risk Management

- Plan for lower bound (pessimistic)
- Expect point estimate (realistic)
- Hope for upper bound (optimistic)

### 4. Consider Business Context

Statistical significance ≠ Business significance

**Example**:
- Coefficient = 0.001, p < 0.001 (statistically significant)
- But $1 increase → $0.001 revenue (not business significant)

### 5. Monitor Model Performance Over Time

Use rolling regressions to detect changes in relationships:

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_5_monitor_model_performance_over_time.sql -->

### 6. Combine Multiple Models

Don't rely on single model - triangulate with multiple approaches:

<!-- include: test/sql/guide04_6_combine_multiple_models.sql -->
